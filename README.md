# Text-to-Speech
Text to speech program that takes a large input file and exports an mp3.

I am working to make it work more quickly by having it read files sooner. Right now it takes the entire file and turns it into an an mp3 and exports it. This takes far too long for most people to go along with it so I have to break it down so that while it is running and processing the rest it is already reading.
