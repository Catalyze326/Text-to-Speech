I
THE FEW AND THE MANY

Literary criticism is traditionally employed in

judging books. Any-judgement it implies about
men’s reading of books is a corollary from its judge-
ment on the books themselves. Bad taste is, as it
were by definition, a taste for bad books. I want to
find out what sort of picture we shall get by revers-
ing the process. Let us make our distinction be-
tween readers or types of reading the basis, and our
distinction between books the corollary. Let us try
to discover how far it might be plausible to define a
good book as a book which is read in one way, and a
bad ‘book as a book which is read in another.

I think this worth trying because the normal pro-
cedure seems to me to involve almost continually
a false implication. If we say that A likes (or has a
taste for) the women’s magazines and B likes (or
has a taste for) Dante, this sounds as if kes and
taste have the same meaning when applied to both;
as if there were a single activity, though the objects
to.which it is directed are different. But observation
convinces me.that this, at least usually, is. untrue.

Already in our schooldays some of us were making
our first responses to good literature. these the majority, were reading, at school, The
Captain, and, at home, short-lived novels from the
circulating library. But it was apparent then that
the majority did not ‘like’ their fare in the way we
‘liked’ ours. It is apparent still. The differences
leap to the eye.

Inthe first place, the majority never read any-
thing twice. The sure mark-of an unliterary man is
that he considers ‘I’ve read it already’ to bea con-
clusive argument against reading a work. We have
all known women who remembered a novel so dimly
that they had to stand for half an hour in-the library
skimming through it before they were. certain they
had once read it. But the moment they became
certain, they rejected it immediately... It was. for
them dead, like.a burnt-out match, an old railway
ticket, or yesterday’s paper; they hadi already used
it. Those who read great works, on the other hand,
will read the same work ten, twenty or thirty:times
during the course:of their life. — /

Secondly, the majority, though. they are some-
times frequent readers, do not set much’ store’ by
reading. They ‘turn. to it as a last resource. They
abandon it with alacrity as soon as any alternative
pastime turns’up.. It is kept for railway journeys,
illnesses, odd:moments: of enforced ‘solitude, or.for
the process called ‘reading oneself ‘to sleep’. They
sometimes combine it with desultory conversation;
often, with listening to the radio. But literary people
are always looking for leisure and silence read and do so with their whole attention. When
they are denied such attentive and undisturbed
reading even fora few days they feel impoverished.

Thirdly, the first reading of some literary work is
often, to the literary, an experience so momentous
that only experiences: of love, religion, or bereave-
ment can furnish a standard of comparison. Their
whole consciousness is changed. They have become
what they were not before. But there is no sign of
anything like this among the other sort of readers.
When. they have finished the story or the novel,
nothing much, or nothing at all, seems to have

- happened to them.

Finally, and as a natural result of their. different
behaviour in reading, what they have read is con-
stantly and prominently present to the mind of the
few, but not to that of the:many. The former mouth
over their favourite lines and stanzas in solitude.
Scenes ‘and characters ‘from books provide them
with a sort.of iconography. by which they interpret
or sum up their own-experience. They talk to one
another about-books; often and at length. The latter
seldom think or talk of their reading.

It is:pretty clear.that the majority, if they spoke
without passion.and were fully articulate, would not
accuse. us of liking the wrong books, but of making
such a fuss. about any books atall. We treat as a main
ingredient in: our well-being something which to
them is marginal. .Hence-to say simply that they
like one thing and we another is the whole of the facts. If like is the correct word for
what they do to books, some other word must be
found for what we do. Or, conversely, if we Hike our
kind of book we must not.say that they “ke any
book. If the few have ‘good taste’, then we may
have to say that no such thing as ‘bad taste’ exists:
for the inclination which the many have to their sort
of reading is not the same thing and, if the word were
univocally used, would not be called taste at all.
Though I shall concern myself almost entirely
with literature, it is worth noting thatthe same
difference of attitude is. displayed about the other
arts and about natural beauty. Many people enjoy
popular music in a. way which is compatible with
humming the tune, stamping in time, talking, and
eating.. And when the popular tune has. once gone
out of fashion they enjoy it no more. Those who
enjoy Bach react quite differently.. Some buy pic-
tures because the walls ‘look so bare without them’;
and after the pictures have been in the house for a
week they become practically invisible to them. But
there are a few who feed ona great picture for years.
As regards nature, the ‘majority ‘like a nice view as
wellas anyone’. They are not saying a word against it.
But to make the landscapes a really important factor
in, say, choosing the place for a holiday—to:put them
on a level with such: serious considerations. as a
luxurious hotel, a good golf links; and-a- sunny
climate—would seem to them affectation. To II
FALSE CHARACTERISATIONS

readers of the one kind are many and those of

the other few, and the two kinds are not charac-
terised by these numerical terms. Our business is
with different ways of reading. Common observa-
tion has already enabled us to make a rough and
ready description, but we must try to penetrate
further. The first step is to eliminate some hasty
identifications of the ‘few’ and the ‘many’.

Some critics write of those who constitute the
literary ‘many’ as if they belonged to the many in
every respect, and indeed to the rabble. They accuse
them of illiteracy, barbarism, ‘crass’, ‘crude’ and
‘stock’ responses which (it is suggested) must make
them clumsy and insensitive in all the relations of
life and render them.a permanent danger to civilisa-
tion. It sometimes sounds as if the reading of
‘popular’ fiction involved moral turpitude. I do not
find this borne out by experience. I have a notion
that these ‘many’ include certain people who are
equal or superior to some of the few in psychological
health, in ‘moral virtue, practical prudence, good
manners, and general adaptability: And-we percentage of the ignorant, the caddish, the stunted,
the warped, and the truculent. With the hasty and
wholesale apartheid of those who ignore this we
must have nothing to do.

If it had no other defect it would still be too dia-
grammatic. The two sorts of readers are not cut off
by immovable. barriers. Individuals who once be-
longed to the many are converted and join the few.
Others desert from the few to the many, as we often
sadly. discover on meeting an: old. schoolfellow.
Those who are.on the: ‘popular’ level as. regards
one art. may be deeply appreciative of another;
musicians sometimes have deplorable preferences in
poetry. And many whose responses:toall the arts
are trivial ‘may yet be people of great intelligence,
learning and ‘subtlety. .

_ This Jatter phenomenon does not surprise us
much. because, their learning is of a different.sort
from ours, and: the subtlety of a philosopher. or
physicist is different from that of a. literary person.
What is ‘more. surprising and disquieting is the fact
that ‘those who: might be expected ex officio to have
a profound and. permanent appreciation of literature
may in-reality have nothing of the sort; They are
mere professionals. Perhaps they once‘had:the full
response, ‘but: the ‘hammer, hammer,:hammer. on
the hard, high road’ has:long.since:dinned it out. of
them. I-am:thinking:-of unfortunate: scholars. in
foreign ‘universities: who, cannot. ‘hold..down. their
jobs’ unless they repeatedly publish articles each of

Page which must say, or seem to sdy, something new
aboutsomeliterary work; orof overworked reviewers,
getting through novel after novel.as quickly as they
can, like a schoolboy doing his ‘prep’. For such
people reading often becomes mere work. The text
before them comes to-exist not in its own right but
simply as raw material;.clay out.of which they can
complete their tale of bricks. Accordingly we often
find that in their leisure hours. they read, if at all,
as the many read. I well remember the snub I once
got from:a man to whom, as we came away from. an
examiners’ meeting, I tactlessly mentioned a great
poet on whom -several candidates had written
answers. His’ attitude (I’ve forgotten the words)
might be expressed in the form ‘Good God, man,
do you want to go on after hours? Didn’t you hear
the hooter. blow?’ For those who are reduced to
this condition by economic necessity and overwork
Thave nothing but sympathy. Unfortunately, ambi-
tion and combativeness can also: produce it. And,
however: it is. produced, it destroys. appreciation.
The ‘few’ whom we are seeking cannot be identified
with the cognoscenti. Neither Gigadibs nor Dryasdust
is necessarily among. them.

Still less is the: status seeker. As there are, or
were, families and circles in which it was almost a
social necessity to display an interest in hunting, or
county cricket, or the Army List, so there are
others. where: it requires great independence not to
talk about, and therefore occasionally approved literature, especially the new and
astonishing works, and those which have been
banned or have become in some other way subjects
of controversy. Readers of this sort, this ‘small
vulgar’, act in one respect exactly like those of the
‘great vulgar’.. They are entirely’ dominated by
fashion. They drop the Georgians and begin to.ad-
mire Mr Eliot, acknowledge the ‘dislodgement’ of
Milton, and discover Hopkins; at exactly the right
moment. They will not like your book if the dedica-
tion begins with 7o instead of For. Yet, while this
goes on downstairs, the only real literary experience
in such a family may be occurring in a back bed-
room where a-small boy is reading Treasure Island
under the bed-clothes by the light of an electric
torch.

The devotee of culture is, as a person, worth
much more than the status seeker. He reads as he
also visits art galleries and concert rooms, not to
make himself acceptable, but to improve himself, to
develop: his ‘potentialities, to become a more com-
plete man. He is:sincere and may be modest. Far
from trotting along obediently: with the fashion,
he is more likely to stick: too exclusively’ to the
‘established authors’ of all periods and ‘nations, ‘the
best that has been thought:and ‘said’ in the world’.
He‘makes few experiments:and has few’ favourites.
Yet this worthy man may be, in the sense I am con-
cerned with dumb-bells every morning may be from being
a lover of games. The playing of games will ordi-
narily contribute to a man’s bodily perfection; but
if that becomes the sole or chief reason for playing
them they cease to be games and become ‘exercise’.

No doubt, a-man who has a taste for games (and
for overeating as well) may very properly act on the
medical motive when he makes for himself a rule to
give general priority to his taste for games. In the
same way, a man who has a gust both for good
literature and for mere time-killing with trash may
reasonably, on.cultural grounds, on principle, give
a priority to the former. But in both instances we
are presupposing a genuine gust. The first man
chooses football rather-than a. gargantuan lunch be-
cause the game, as well as the lunch, is one of the
things he enjoys. The second turns to Racine in-
stead of E. R. Burroughs because Andromaque, as
well as Tarzan, is really attractive to him. But to
come to the particular game with’ nothing but a
hygienic motive or to the.tragedy with nothing but
a desire for self-improvement, is not really to play
the one or to receive the other: Both attitudes fix
the ultimate intention on oneself. Both treat as a
means. something which must, while you play or
read it, be accepted for its own sake. You ought to
be: thinking about goals not about ‘fitness’. Your
mind: ought to be absorbed—and, if so, what time
have you for so bleak an abstraction as carved in alexandrines’ are the pieces and human
beings are the squares.!

This. laborious sort of misreading is perhaps
especially prevalent in our own age. One-sad result
of making English Literature a “subject” at schools
and universities is that the reading of great authors
is, from early years, stamped upon the minds of
conscientious and submissive young people as some-
thing meritorious.. When the young person .in
question is an agnostic whose ancestors were Puri-
tans, you get a very regrettable state of mind: The
Puritan conscience works on without the Puritan
theology—like millstones grinding nothing; like
digestive juices working on an empty stomach and
producing ulcers. The unhappy youth -applies to
literature all the scruples, the rigorism, the self-
examination, the distrust of pleasure; which. his
forebears applied:to the spiritual life; and perhaps
soon all the intolerance and self-righteousness. The
doctrine of Dr I. A. Richards in: which the correct
reading of good poetry has-a veritable therapeutic
value confirms him in this attitude. The Muses
assume the role:of the Eumenides. A young woman
most penitently. confessed to a friend of mine that
an unholy desire’ to: read the women’s maagarinies
washer besetting * temptation’.

It is-the existence of these literary Puritans that
has deterred me ftom applying the word serious to
the. right sort of readers itself at first as just the word we want. But it is
fatally equivocal. It may mean, on the one hand,
something like ‘grave’ or ‘solemn’; on the other,
something more like ‘thoroughgoing, whole-hearted,
energetic’. Thus we-say that Smith is ‘a serious
man’, meaning that he is the reverse of gay, and
that Wilson is ‘a serious student’, meaning that he
studies hard. The serious man, far from being a
serious student, may be’a dabbler and a dilettante.
The-serious student may be as playful as Mercutio.
A thing may: be done seriously in the one sense and
yet not in the other. The man who plays football
for his health is a serious man: but-no real footballer
will call him a serious: player. He is not whole-
hearted about the game; doesn’t really care. His
seriousness.as a man. indeed involves. his frivolity
asa player; he only “plays at playing’, pretends to
play. Now the true-reader reads every work seri-
ously in thesense that he reads. it whole-heartedly,
makes himself as receptive as he can. But for that
very reason: he cannot possibly read every work
solemnly or gravely. For he-will read ‘in the same
spirit that the author writ’. What is meant lightly
he will take lightly; what is meant gravely, gravely.
He will ‘laugh and shake in Rabelais’ easy chair’
while he reads: Chaucer’s. faibliaux and respond
with exquisite frivolity to The Rape of the Lock. He
will enjoy a kickshaw as a-kickshaw and a tragedy
as a tragedy. .He. will never commit the error of
trying to munch whipped This is where the literary Puritans may fail most
lamentably. They are too serious as men to be
seriously receptive as readers. I have listened to an
undergraduate’s paper on Jane Austen from which,
if I had not read them, I should never have dis-
covered that there was the least hint of comedy in
her novels. After a lecture of my own I have been
accompanied from Mill Lane to Magdalene by a
young man protesting with real anguish and horror
against ‘my wounding, my vulgar, my irreverent,
suggestion
